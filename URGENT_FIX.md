# ✅ Database Connection Issue - FIXED

## Issue Summary
Connection resets (P1001 errors) were crashing the farmers page.

## What Was Done ✅

### 1. Added Retry Logic
- File: `lib/prisma.js`
- Feature: `withRetry()` with exponential backoff
- Behavior: 3 attempts with 500ms, 1s, 2s delays

### 2. Updated Database APIs
- File: `pages/api/farmers/index.js`
- File: `pages/api/farmers/analytics.js`
- Changes: Use retry logic, return 503 on failure

### 3. Improved Frontend Resilience
- File: `pages/farmers/index.js`
- Changes: Handle 503 responses, show empty data

### 4. Created Documentation
- `CONNECTION_ERROR_RESOLUTION.md` - Main guide
- `DATABASE_CONNECTION_FIX.md` - Troubleshooting
- `DATABASE_RETRY_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Summary
- `RETRY_LOGIC_REFERENCE.md` - Developer reference

## Result ✅

**Before:** Connection fails → 500 error crash  
**After:** Connection fails → Auto-retry → Return 503 + empty data → Page works

## Deployment

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "fix: add retry logic for database connections"
git push
```

**No special config needed!** ✅

### Step 3: Regenerate Prisma Client
```bash
npx prisma generate
```

This should complete successfully now.

### Step 4: Restart Dev Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 5: Test the Form
Go to any farm edit page and try to save - should work now!

## If Step 3 Fails

If `npx prisma generate` still fails with "EPERM" error:

### Alternative: Restart Your Computer
Sometimes Windows locks the files. A restart will release all locks.

After restart:
1. Open terminal
2. `cd ccsa-mobile-api`
3. `npx prisma generate`
4. `npm run dev`

---

## Quick Verification

After regenerating, check the schema matches:
```bash
cat prisma/schema.prisma | grep "secondaryCrop"
```

Should show:
```
secondaryCrop       String?
```

NOT:
```
secondaryCrop       String[]
```

---

## What Changed

**Before (Causing Error):**
```prisma
secondaryCrop String[]  // Array - doesn't match database
```

**After (Fixed):**
```prisma
secondaryCrop String?   // Single string - matches database
```

The form now saves secondary crops as: `"Maize, Rice, Cassava"` (comma-separated)

**Priority**: HIGH - Must regenerate Prisma client
